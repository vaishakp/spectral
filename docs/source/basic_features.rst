Basic Features
*********************

This is a python module for various spectral tools and transforms. It provides ready to use, out of the box, fast, cached, memory efficient

* Fourier transforms
  Conventions taken care of.
* Chebyshev transforms
  Including interpolations and derivatives.
* Spin-weighted spherical harmonic transforms
  To arbitrary precision, parallelized using multiprocessing
* A 3D spectral interpolator enabled by Angular Spherical Harmonic + Radial Chebyshev transforms and MPI
* Gauss Legendre and Uniform angular grids, Gauss-Lobatto collocation grids
